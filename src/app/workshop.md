# Workshop for this step

Add route driven data loading to your project. You already have a list
of videos on the screen - make it so that clicking on one will load
viewer statistics about that one in the view breakdown component.

You can request a single item from the JSON server, as long as the items
in the array contain an "id" property. For example:

http://localhost:8085/videos/(id)

https://api.angularbootcamp.com/videos/(id)

(Adjust as appropriate if you API URL is different)

Displaying the stats can be as simple or complex as you desire.
The purpose of this workshop is to exercise the fetching of route based data.
